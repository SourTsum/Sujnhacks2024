## Inspiration
We were inspired by the video game series known as Five Nights At Freddy's. Our gameplay is not similar to the core gameplay of the series but is inspired by the mini-games within the game.
## How we built it
We built the game using pure Java with much blood, sweat, and tears. Lots of tears. Don't use Java for game development. We also used an open-source JSON manager called [JSON Simple](https://github.com/fangyidong/json-simple).
## Challenges we ran into
A lot of issues relating to Java Swing with our panels and frames not interacting as intended. Implementing mini-games with Java Swing was also very difficult.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating a finished build of the game during our first hackathon ever. 
## What we learned
Working as a team and utilizing JetBrains IDEs to collaborate, in combination with GitHub for project management. 
## What's Next for Five Nights at Tookers
Implementing more game mechanics and making the game more educational to train future CAs.
